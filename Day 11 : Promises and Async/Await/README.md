# Day 11 : Promises and Async/Await

## Activity 1 : Understanding Promises
### TAsk 1 : Create a promises that resolves witha message after 2 second timeout and log the message to the console.
### Task 2 : Create a promise that reject with an error message after 2 second timeout and handle the error using .catch().

## Activity 2 : Chaining Promises
### Task 3 : Create a sequence of promises that simulate fetching data from a server. Chain the promises to log message in specific order.

## Activity 3 : Using Async/Await
### Task 4 : Write an Async function that waits for an promise to resolve and then logs the resolved value.
### Task 5 : Write a async function that handles a rejected promise using try-catch and logs the error message.

## Activity 4 : Fetching data from an API
### Task 6 : Use a fetch API to get data from public API and log the data to the console using promises.
### Task 7 : Use a fetch API to get data from public API and log the data to the console using Async Await.

## Activity 5 : Concurrent Promises
### Task 8 : Use Promise.all to wait for multiple promises to resolve and then log their values.
### Task 9 : Use promise.race to log the value of the first promise that resolves among multiple promises.
